This website is under construction! Everything subject to change. Exam dates and
times, and projects are all TBA. This is copied from the previous semester so things
will change.

If you have urgent questions about the course, please email
`cs61b (at) berkeley.edu`{: .blue}. You will get a faster response than
emailing an instructor.

We know that the links may be broken. If you want to get a head start on the content, you can check out the [Spring 2023 course website](https://sp23.datastructur.es/).

Course policies and other administrative stuff coming soon!

Again, don't trust what you see below!
