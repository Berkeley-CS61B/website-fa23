## Incompletes

Incomplete grades can be assigned if your work has been of "passing quality". You will have an Incomplete (I) grade for the semester and receive extended completion deadlines to submit the incomplete assignments. More information can be found on the official website [here](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/faculty-staff/grading/incomplete-grades/).

A couple important requirements from the website:

- "Students who fail to turn in all required work cannot request an I grade unless they have been unable to finish because of circumstances beyond their control."
- Your work must be of "passing quality", meaning that completing the projects/exams you're taking an incomplete for would bring you to at least a passing grade in the course. The grade bins can be found in [the syllabus](../../about.md#grades).

In CS61B, you may receive an incomplete on at most **2 projects** or **1 project/1 exam**.

## Incomplete deadlines

- By default, the deadline to turn in incomplete assignments will be Friday, January 13th (1/13). We will not be granting further extensions aside from exceptional cases.
- If you are taking an incomplete on the final, you will take the Spring 2024 final exam. The date and time is not known yet.

## Is an incomplete right for you?

An incomplete does grant you additional time on assignments that you may not have been able to complete during the semester due to extenuating circumstances. However, there are drawbacks as well.

- You'll be working on the assignments during break, so you should expect to complete the assignments without official staff support.
- Especially if you're taking an incomplete on the final, you'll be completing the incomplete work in addition to your usual coursework.

An alternative to taking an incomplete is [late dropping](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/late-change-class-schedule) the course. With another chance at the course, you'll have more time to learn the fundamental concepts and also a chance to improve your grade more. Many 61B assignments don't change much from semester to semester, so a lot of your efforts this semester can be reused if you decide to retake the course. The late drop deadline is **Friday, December 1st (12/1)**.

## Requesting an incomplete

To request an incomplete, please fill out this form by **Friday, December 8th (12/8) at 11:59pm**. We will be processing incomplete requests on a rolling basis.

## Submitting incomplete assignments

You should submit incomplete assignments the same way you submit assignments during the semester. Most of these will be autograded through Gradescope, but some assignments like Project 3 may require you to fill out other forms. We will schedule Project 3 checkoffs when we return next semester.
