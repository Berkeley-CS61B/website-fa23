## [FAQ](faq.md)

Each assignment will have an FAQ linked at the top. You can also access it by
adding "/faq" to the end of the URL. The FAQ for Project 1A is located
[here](faq.md).

## Introduction

In Project 0, you were a _client_ of a variety of abstract data types in
`java.util`. In Project 1A and 1B (and some upcoming labs), you will implement
your own versions of these data structures! In Project 1, you'll begin by
building your own versions of the list-like structure: implementations of a new
abstract data type called a Double Ended Queue (deque, pronounced "deck").

By the end of Project 1A, you will...

- Gain an understanding of the usage of a backing linked list in
  datastructures.
- Have experience with using testing and test-driven development to evaluate
  the correctness of your own datastructures.

For Project 1A, we will provide a significant amount of scaffolding by giving
explicit instructions. In Project 1B, you'll be doing a similar task, but with
much less scaffolding.

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="
This section assumes you have watched and fully digested the lectures up till
the DLList lecture, Lecture 5.
" %}

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="
For this project, you must work alone! Please carefully read the
[Policy on Collaboration and Cheating](../../../about.md#project-collaboration-policy)
to see what this means exactly. In particular, do not look for solutions online.
" %}

{% include alert.html type="danger" content="
It should go without saying that you may not use any of the built-in
`java.util` data structures in your implementation! The whole point is to build
your own versions! There are a few places where you may use specific data
structures outside of tests, and we will clearly say where.
" %}

### Style

Starting with this project, **we will be enforcing style**. You must follow the
[style guide](../../guides/style/index.md), or you will be penalized on the
autograder.

You can and should check your style locally with the CS 61B plugin. **We will
not remove the velocity limit for failing to check style.**

### Getting the Skeleton Files

Follow the instructions in the
[Assignment Workflow guide](../../guides/assignment-workflow/index.md/#assignment-workflow)
to get the skeleton code and open it in IntelliJ. For this project, we will be
working in the **`proj1a`** directory.

You see a `proj1a` directory appear in your repo with the following structure:

```text
proj1a
├── src
│   └── Deque.java
└── tests
    ├── LinkedListDequeTest.java
    └── NodeChecker.java
```

If you get some sort of error, STOP and either figure it out by carefully
reading the [git WTFs](../../guides/git/wtfs/index.md) or seek help at OH
or Ed. You'll potentially save yourself a lot of trouble vs. guess-and-check
with git commands. If you find yourself trying to use commands recommended by
Google like `force push`,
[don't](https://twitter.com/heathercmiller/status/526770571728531456).
**Don't use force push, even if a post you found on Stack Overflow says to do it!**

You can also watch Professor Hug's [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tABtNcN5y0A)
about how to get started and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Squ8TmG5mX0)
if you encounter some git issues.

## Deque: ADT and API

The double ended queue is very similar to the SLList and AList classes that
we've discussed in class. Here is a definition from the
[Java standard library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html).

> A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.
> The name _deque_ is short for "double ended queue" and is usually pronounced
> "deck". Most `Deque` implementations place no fixed limits on the number of
> elements they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted
> deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.

We don't need all the methods defined in Java's `Deque`, and have defined
our own interface, which can be found in `src/Deque.java`.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: Begin by opening the `Deque.java` file and **reading** the
documentation in it. We **will not** repeat information that is in the
interface file in the specification -- so, it is _on you_ to make sure that you
are reading it as you complete the project.

**You should not edit `Deque.java`.**

## `LinkedListDeque`

### Assignment Philosophy

A common beginner mistake is to write a large amount of code and hope that it
all works once you're finished. This makes life very difficult for a
programmer. Imagine implementing all the methods above, submitting to the
autograder, and getting back a message that says something like "call to `get`
returned 9, expected 7". You have no idea if the problem is the `get` method
itself, or if some other necessary methods are broken.

To help encourage better programming habits, in Project 1A, we're going to hold
your hands through the development process. You are not strictly required to
follow the recommended steps, i.e. if you pass the autograder, then you get all
the points, but we strongly encourage you to follow the steps outlined in
this spec.

{% include alert.html type="danger" content="
For the intended experience, follow these steps in order. If you do something
else and ask us for help, we will refer you back to these steps.
" %}

### Creating the File

Start by creating a file called `LinkedListDeque`. This file should be created
in the `proj1a/src` directory. To do this, right-click on the `src` directory,
navigate to "New -> Java Class", and give it the name `LinkedListDeque`.

We want our `LinkedListDeque` to be able to hold several different types. For
example, a `LinkedListDeque<String>` holds `String`s and a
`LinkedListDeque<Integer>` holds `Integer`s. To enable this, you should
edit the declaration of your class so that it reads:

```java
public class LinkedListDeque<T>
```

Recall from lecture that it doesn't actually matter if we use `T` or some other
string like `LinkedListDeque<Glerp>`. However, we recommend using `<T>` for
consistency with other Java code.

We also want to tell Java that every `LinkedListDeque` is a `Deque`, so that
users can write code like `Deque<String> lld1 = new LinkedListDeque<>();`. 
To enable this, change the declaration of your class so that it reads:

```java
public class LinkedListDeque<T> implements Deque<T>
```

However, this creates an error. In order for a `LinkedListDeque` to be a 
`Deque`, it needs to implement all the `Deque` methods. However your mouse over
the red squiggle, and click the "implement methods" button when the error
message box pops up. This will autogenerate the method headers for you.

The below GIF goes through these steps:

![Proj 1A Setup](img/proj1a-setup.gif)

Lastly, you should create an empty constructor. To do this, add the following
code to your file, leaving the constructor blank for now.

```java
public LinkedListDeque() {
}
```

Note: You can also generate the constructor by clicking "Code", then "Generate"
then "Constructor", though I prefer the typing the code yourself approach.

Now you're ready to get started!

### JUnit Tests

Now open the `LinkedListDequeTest.java` file. You'll see that every line has a
`//` preceding it. Let's remove all of the `//` comments except last line. To do
this, highlight all the lines of the file that start with `//`. Then click
"Code" in the top menu bar, then "Comment with Line Comment". All the lines
should now be uncommented. You can also use `Ctrl+/` (Windows / Linux) or
`⌘ /` / `Cmd+/` (Mac).

Now click and run all the tests. You should fail nearly all the tests since
you haven't implemented any methods yet.

Before you can pass these tests, there's a lot of work you'll need to do, so
we're going to set aside the tests for now and come back to them much later.

### Writing and Verifying the Constructor

{% include alert.html type="info" content="
This section assumes you have watched and fully digested the lectures up to
**and including** the `DLList` lecture, Lecture 5.
" %}

Start by selecting a "topology," or structure that you'd like to represent the
empty list. The possible choices discussed in lecture are:

- The empty list is represented by a null value. [See this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10JSf8_Cut4kodFP3MxoPovUVjTGWZ6YFyIuT95NyqTk/edit#slide=id.g829fe3f43_0_146).
- The empty list is represented by two sentinel nodes that point at each
  other. The first sentinel node is pointed to by a variable called `first`,
  and the last sentinel node is pointed to by a variable called `last`.
  [See this slide.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10JSf8_Cut4kodFP3MxoPovUVjTGWZ6YFyIuT95NyqTk/edit#slide=id.g829fe3f43_0_291)
- **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: The empty list is represented by a single sentinel
  node that points at itself. There is a single instance variable called
  `sentinel` that points at this sentinel.
  [See this slide.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10JSf8_Cut4kodFP3MxoPovUVjTGWZ6YFyIuT95NyqTk/edit#slide=id.g829fe3f43_0_376)

As mentioned in lecture, though this last approach seems the most complicated
at first, it will ultimately lead to the simplest implementation.

Implement the constructor for `LinkedListDeque` to match your chosen topology.
Along the way you'll need to create a `Node` class and introduce one or more
instance variables. This may take you some time to understand fully. Your
`LinkedListDeque` constructor **must** take 0 arguments.

You're welcome to pick whichever choice you'd like, but it **must** "look like"
a `DLList`. That is, the nodes should be doubly linked, and have exactly the
necessary fields for a doubly linked node. Additionally, you should only have
one node class, and this node class **must** be an inner, or nested class
inside `LinkedListDeque`.

When you're done, set a breakpoint on the first line of `addFirstTestBasic`.
Run the test in debug mode, and use
the Step Over (![step-over](img/step-over.png){: .inline}) feature. Use the
Java Visualizer to verify that your created object matches the topology you
chose.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: Pick a doubly-linked list topology, and implement the constructor. Implement a Node Class. (You would also probably need some instance variables.)

---

If the test `noNonTrivialFields` fails, your `Node` class is **insufficient** in
some way:

- It might be defined in a separate file.
- It might be using an incorrect type to store data. Remember that `Deque` is
  _generic_.
- It might have a constructor that takes additional arguments.
- It might have too few or too many fields for a doubly-linked node.

---

The tests will not work until you complete `toList`.

" %}

### Writing and Verifying `addFirst` and `addLast`

`addFirst` and `addLast` **may not** use looping or recursion. A single add
operation must take \"constant time,\" that is, adding an element should take
approximately the same amount of time no matter how large the deque is. This
means that you cannot use loops that iterate through all / most elements of the deque.

Fill in the `addFirst` and `addLast` methods. Then, debug
`addFirstAndAddLastTest`. This test will not pass because you haven't written
`toList` yet, but you can use the debugger and visualizer to verify that
your code is working correctly.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: Implement `addFirst` and `addLast`, and verify that they are correct
using `addFirstAndAddLastTest` and the Java visualizer.

---

The tests will not work until you complete the next section, `toList`.
" %}

### Writing and Verifying `toList`

You may have found it somewhat tedious and unpleasant to use the debugger and
visualizer to verify the correctness of your `addFirst` and `addLast` methods.
There is also the problem that such manual verification becomes stale as soon
as you change your code. Imagine that you made some minor but uncertain change
to `addLast`. To verify that you didn't break anything you'd have to go back
and do that whole process again. Yuck.

(Also, we have just under 1300 students! No way we're doing that to grade
everyone's work.)

What we really want are some automated tests. But unfortunately there's no easy
way to verify correctness of `addFirst` and `addLast` if those are the only two
methods we've implemented. That is, there's currently no way to iterate over
our list and get back its values and see that they are correct.

That's where the `toList` method comes in. When called, this method returns a
`List` representation of the `Deque`. For example, if the `Deque` has had
`addLast(5)`, `addLast(9)`, `addLast(10)`, then `addFirst(3)` called on it,
then the result of `toList()` should be a `List` with 3 at the front, then 5,
then 9, then 10. If printed in Java, it'd show up as `[3, 5, 9, 10]`.

Write the `toList` method. The first line of the method should be something
like `List<T> returnList = new ArrayList<>()`. **This is one location where you
are allowed to use a Java data structure.** You can import ArrayList by using IntelliJ's auto import or copying this statement:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList; // import the ArrayList class
```

To verify that your `toList` method is working correctly, you can run the tests
in `LinkedListDequeTest`. If you pass all the tests, you've established a firm
foundation upon which to continue working on the project. Woo! If not, use the
debugger and carefully investigate to see what's wrong with your `toList`
method. If you get really stuck, go back and verify that your `addFirst` and
`addLast` methods are working.

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="
Some later methods might seem easy if you use `toList`.
**You may not call `toList` inside `LinkedListDeque`**; there is a test that
checks for this.
" %}

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: Implement `toList`, and verify that it is correct with the tests
in `LinkedListDequeTest`.
" %}

### The Testing Component

In Project 0, we gave you a full suite of unit tests that you could use to test
your code locally. In this project, you'll be required to write _your own_ unit
test suite that provides similar coverage. To give a bit of insight about how
this works, we will essentially be taking your test file
(`LinkedListDequeTest.java`) and using it to "test" our staff solution of
`LinkedListDeque`. Using some autograder magic, we're able to determine which
edge cases your tests are able to hit, thus telling us the "coverage" of your
test suite. So, in order to get a full score on this component, you should try to
think of any and all corner cases for each of the methods!

Our staff solution uses a circular sentinel topology. Our staff solution also
only has a constructor that takes 0 arguments, which means that your tests
should only use a constructor that takes 0 arguments.

### Writing Tests

To write tests, we will use Google's [Truth](https://truth.dev/) assertions
library. We use this library over JUnit assertions for the following reasons:

- Better failure messages for lists.
- Easier to read and write tests.
- Larger assertions library out of the box.

We often write tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

1.  **Arrange** the test case, such as instantiating the data structure or
    filling it with elements.
2.  **Act** by performing the behavior you want to test.
3.  **Assert** the result of the action in (2).

We will often have multiple "act" and "assert" steps in a single test method
to reduce the amount of boilerplate (repeated) code.

You should write your tests in `LinkedListDequeTest.java`.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Note**: The tests that you write in this project will be checked for the
different \"scenarios\" they cover. You will need to cover sufficiently many
scenarios, including a few edge cases.
" %}

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="
**Warning**: While the coverage checker can check how much you *do* to the
deque, it doesn't check what you *assert* about the deque. If you find yourself
failing autograder tests that you think you have coverage for, a good next step
is to add additional assertions to your own tests. Examples include verifying
the result of every call, checking the entire deque between every call, or
checking the results of other deque methods.
" %}

#### Truth Assertions

A Truth assertion takes the following format:

```java
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);
```

To add a message to the assertion, we can instead use:

```java
assertWithMessage("actual is not expected")
    .that(actual)
    .isEqualTo(expected);
```

We can use things other than `isEqualTo`, depending on the type of `actual`.
For example, if `actual` is a `List`, we could do the following to check its
contents without constructing a new `List`:

```java
assertThat(actualList)
    .containsExactly(0, 1, 2, 3)
    .inOrder();
```

If we had a `List` or other reference object, we could use:

```java
assertThat(actualList)
    .containsExactlyElementsIn(expected)  // `expected` is a List
    .inOrder();
```

Truth has many assertions, including `isNull` and `isNotNull`; and
`isTrue` and `isFalse` for `boolean`s. IntelliJ's autocomplete will often give
you suggestions for which assertion you can use.

#### Example Test

Let's break down the provided `addLastTestBasic`:

```java
@Test
/** In this test, we use only one assertThat statement. IMO this test is just as good as addFirstTestBasic.
    *  In other words, the tedious work of adding the extra assertThat statements isn't worth it. */
public void addLastTestBasic() {
    Deque<String> lld1 = new LinkedListDeque<>();

    lld1.addLast("front"); // after this call we expect: ["front"]
    lld1.addLast("middle"); // after this call we expect: ["front", "middle"]
    lld1.addLast("back"); // after this call we expect: ["front", "middle", "back"]
    assertThat(lld1.toList()).containsExactly("front", "middle", "back").inOrder();
}
```

- `@Test` tells Java that this is method is a _test_, and should be run when
  we run tests.
- **Arrange**: We construct a new `Deque`, and add 3 elements to it using
  `addLast`.
- **Act**: We call `toList` on `Deque`. This implicitly depends on the
  earlier `addLast` calls.
- **Assert**: We use a Truth assertion to check that the `toList` contains
  specific elements in a specific order.

### The Remaining Methods

All that's left is to test and implement all the remaining methods. For the
rest of this project, we'll describe our suggested steps at a high level. We
**strongly encourage** you to follow the remaining steps in the order given.
In particular, **write tests before you implement.** This is called
"test-driven development," and helps ensure that you know what your methods are
supposed to do before you do them.

#### `isEmpty` and `size`

These two methods must take **constant time**. That is, the time it takes to for
either method to finish execution should not depend on how many elements are in
the deque.

Write one or more tests for `isEmpty` and `size`. Run them and verify that they
fail. **Your test(s) should verify more than one interesting case,** such as
checking both an empty and a nonempty list, or checking that the size changes.

For these tests, you can use the `isTrue` or `isFalse` methods on your
`assertThat` statements.

Your tests can range from very fine-grained, e.g. `testIsEmpty`, `testSizeZero`,
`testSizeOne` to very coarse grained, e.g. `testSizeAndIsEmpty`. It's up to you
to explore and find what granularity you prefer.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: **Write tests** for the `isEmpty` and `size` methods, and check that
they fail. Then, implement the methods.
" %}

#### `get`

Write a test for the `get` method. Make sure to test the cases where `get`
receives an invalid argument, e.g. `get(28723)` when the `Deque` only has 1
item, or a negative index. In these cases `get` should return `null`.

`get` must use iteration.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: **After you've written tests and verified that they fail**, implement
`get`.
" %}

#### `getRecursive`

Since we're working with a linked list, it is interesting to write a recursive
get method, `getRecursive`.

Copy and paste your tests for the `get` method so that they are the same except
they call `getRecursive`. (While there is a way to avoid having copy and pasted
tests, though the syntax is not worth introducing -- passing around functions
in Java is a bit messy.)

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: **After you've copy-pasted tests and verified that they fail**,
implement `getRecursive`.
" %}

#### `removeFirst` and `removeLast`

Lastly, write some tests that test the behavior of `removeFirst` and
`removeLast`, and again ensure that the tests fail. **For these tests you'll
want to use `toList`!** Use `addFirstAndAddLastTest` as a guide.

Do not maintain references to items that are no longer in the deque. The amount
of memory that your program uses at any given time must be proportional to the
number of items. For example, if you add 10,000 items to the deque, and then
remove 9,999 items, the resulting memory usage should amount to a deque with 1
item, and not 10,000. Remember that the Java garbage collector will "delete"
things for us if and only if there are no pointers to that object.

If `Deque` is empty, removing should return `null`.

{% include alert.html type="task" content="
**Task**: **After you've written tests and verified that they fail**, implement
`removeFirst` and `removeLast`.
" %}

### Submit to the Autograder

Once you've written local tests and passed them, try submitting to the
autograder. You may or may not pass everything.

- If you fail any of the coverage tests, it means that there is a case that
  your local tests did not cover. [Here](./flags.md) is a list of test cases that you should cover.
- If you fail any of the timing tests, it means that your implementation does
  not meet the timing constraints described above.
- You will have a token limit of 4 tokens every 24 hours. In the last 2 hours before the deadline, the token limiting will be relaxed and your tokens will recharged every 15 minutes.

### Scoring

This project, similar to Project 0, is divided into individual components, each
of which you must implement _completely correctly_ to receive credit.

1.  **Empty list (5%)**: Define a valid `Node` class and correctly implement
    the constructor.
2.  **Adding (25%)**: Correctly implement `addFirst`, `addLast`, and `toList`.
3.  **`isEmpty`, `size` (5%)**: Correctly implement `isEmpty` and `size` with
    add methods working.
4.  **`get` (10%)**: Correctly implement `get`.
5.  **`getRecursive` (5%)**: Correctly implement `getRecursive`.
6.  **Removing (30%)**: Correctly implement `removeFirst` and `removeLast`.
6.  **Integration (10%)**: Pass a integration test suite that randomly calls all the methods. 

Additionally, there is a **test coverage (10%)** component. We will run your
tests against a staff solution, and check how many scenarios and edge cases are
tested. You can receive partial credit for this component. You can find the list of scenarios [here](./flags.md).
