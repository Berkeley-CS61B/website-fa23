## Setup

### I'm getting an error that `spark failed to ignite`.

This may indicate that some other process is already using Spark and hasn't been terminated. Restarting your computer should fix this.

### I have a divergent branches error after trying the command `git pull`.

Run `git config pull.rebase false` and pull again.

### I'm getting 'Cannot invoke "ngordnet.ngrams.TimeSeries.years()" because "ILILILILIILILIILILIILIL" is null'

Re-pull the libraries in `library-fa23`.

### I tried running `git pull` from `library-fa23` but am still getting the above exception.

Be sure you've re-imported the libraries in IntelliJ after getting the new library files.

### No matter what I do, the libraries still aren't working!

Try deleting the `library-fa23` entirely and re-cloning it.

### I'm getting `Failed to bind to /0.0.0.0:4567` when running `Main.java`.

Save your code and restart IntelliJ. If this doesn't work, try restarting your computer as well.

## HyponymsHandler - Basic Case

### I'm getting `NullPointerException` because object is `null` when `iterator()` is called.

This is a really common issue. Whenever you are trying to iterate through an object with an enhanced-for loop, like this:
`for (<Type> element : elements){...}`

If `elements` is null, you'll get this error, because we can't call `iterator()` on `null`. We recommend you check `elements` to ensure it isn't `null` before iterating.

### I'm getting `NullPointerException` because the output of `get` is `null`.

Recall that if the requested key is not found in the map, then `get` will return `null`. Another cause of this issue may be exploring the children of "sink" nodes (which don't have any children).

## HyponymsHandler - Lists of Words

### I'm getting timeout issues after 60000 ms, or the autograder tells me that I should make sure my code terminates on all inputs.

Be sure you're using the appropriate data structures - do we have to output duplicate words? Everywhere you can reasonably use a `Set` instead of a `List`, you'll save some runtime. Also, make sure you have some way of accessing synsets associated with a given word in constant time. You also shouldn't reconstruct the graph in each call to `handle`.

## HyponymsHandler - k > 0

### How do I tiebreak words with the same counts?

It doesn't matter for this project - any behavior is acceptable. This means you can break ties alphabetically, or randomly, or not at all!

### How should I store total popularity of words?

Think about what you have implemented in Proj 2A. `TimeSeries` values are doubles, not ints. If you store the integer counts, you might get integer overflow.

### How can I find the data file for Test 4.10?
