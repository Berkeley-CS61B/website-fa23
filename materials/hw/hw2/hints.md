If you're stuck on solving backwash, give yourself some time! This is a tricky problem, and the solution might come to you while you're doing something else. 

Do work for another class, eat, exercise, take a nap, and make some artwork in the `InteractivePercolationVisualizer`. 

If you're still stuck after doing all of the above, then it may be time to look at the first hint.

## Hint 1

Highlight the below text to reveal. 

<span style="background-color: black; color: black">
Backwash is caused by the bottom virtual site. What if you didn't have it?
</span>

Still don't know what to do? Don't worry; give yourself some time to come up with a solution. Try drawing a pair of dice in the `InteractivePercolationVisualizer`.
