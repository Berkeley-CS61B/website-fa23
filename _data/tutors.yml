- bio: Hello! I am a 4th year EECS transfer and am always open to offering assistance
    and advice on course materials and on courses. I am currently working hard to
    provide for my cat, Tofu who prefers to play with my hands rather than her toys.
    When not spending time with my cat, I go to cafes in Berkeley!
