- bio: Hello! I am a 4th year EECS transfer and am always open to offering assistance
    and advice on course materials and on courses. I am currently working hard to
    provide for my cat, Tofu who prefers to play with my hands rather than her toys.
    When not spending time with my cat, I go to cafes in Berkeley!

    \ major. Some of my interests include hiking, ballet, and skiing! When I\u2019\
    m not debugging something you can find me going on walks around Berkeley or the\
    \ Fire Trails. There are so many good restaurants in Berkeley but if I had to\
    \ pick one I'd say it's Lucia's (the pizza there is \U0001F90C). A fun fact about\
    \ me is that I absolutely love carrots and always have at least 3 carrot related\
    \ items on me. Can't wait to help teach some data structures :)"
